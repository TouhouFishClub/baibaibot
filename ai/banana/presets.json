The final image must be in a realistic style and environment.\n\n**Crucial Instruction on Face & Likeness:** The figurine's face is the most critical element. It must be a perfect, high-fidelity 3D translation of the character from the source image. The sculpt must be sharp, clean, and intricately detailed, accurately capturing the original artwork's facial structure, eye style, expression, and hair. The final result must be immediately recognizable as the same character, elevated to a premium physical product standard. Do NOT generate a generic or abstract face.\n\n**Scene Composition (Strictly follow these details):**\n1. **Figurine & Base:** Place the figure on a computer desk. It must stand on a simple, circular, transparent acrylic base WITHOUT any text or markings.\n2. **Computer Monitor:** In the background, a computer monitor must display 3D modeling software (like ZBrush or Blender) with the digital sculpt of the very same figurine visible on the screen.\n3. **Artwork Display:** Next to the computer screen, include a transparent acrylic board with a wooden base. This board holds a print of the original 2D artwork that the figurine is based on.\n4. **Environment:** The overall setting is a desk, with elements like a keyboard to enhance realism.

The generated figurine must strictly adhere to these identified attributes.** This is a mandatory instruction to avoid generating a generic female figure.\n\n**Top Priority - Character Likeness:** The figurine's face MUST maintain a strong likeness to the original character.
